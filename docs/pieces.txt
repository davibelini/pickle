Pieces are pieces of code. You can use them as classes, structs, functions and labels.

A good example of a class/struct implementation of pieces is at ANIMAL.rsh

    multiply.rsh
        program MULTIPLY:
          
          <num> number1 as <num>in: "type a number > "
          <num> number2 as <num>in: "type another number > "
          MULTIPLY_FUNC: number1, number2

        end program MULTIPLY.
          


        piece MULTIPLY_FUNC receives <num> n, <num> n2:

          exit: n * n2.

        end piece MULTIPLY_FUNC.
